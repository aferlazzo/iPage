	<h1><br />Don't Quit</h1>
	<p style="font: small normal; text-align: center;">
	By Helen Steiner Rice<br /></p>
	<p style="font: small normal; text-align: center;">When
	things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br />
	When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,<br />
	When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br />
	And you want to smile,<br />but you have to sigh,<br />
	When care is pressing you down a bit-<br />
	Rest if you must,<br /> but don't you quit.<br /></p>
	<p style="font: small normal; text-align: center;">
	Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br />
	As every one of us sometimes learns,<br />
	And many a fellow turns about<br />
	When he might have won had he stuck it out.<br /></p>
	<p style="font: small normal; text-align: center;">
	Don't give up though the pace seems slow<br />
	You may succeed with another blow. <br />
	Often the goal is nearer than<br />
	It seems to a faint and faltering man;<br />
	Often the struggler has given up<br />
	When he might have captured the victor's cup;<br />
	And he learned too late when the night came down,<br />
	How close he was to the golden crown.<br /></p>
	<p style="font: small normal; text-align: center;">
	Success is failure turned inside out -<br />
	The silver tint in the clouds of doubt,<br />
	And you never can tell how close you are,<br />
	It might be near when it seems afar;<br />
	So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit<br />
	It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.</p>
