<dt>Abstract (of title)</dt>
<dd>A written summary of the title history of a particular piece of real estate.</dd>

<dt>Acceleration<br />Clause</dt>
<dd>A provision of a mortgage or note which provides that the entire outstanding
balance will become due and payable in the event of default.</dd>

<dt>Adjustable Rate<br />Mortgage (ARM)</dt>
<dd>A mortgage in which the
                interest rate is adjusted periodically, based on
                the movement of a financial index. See <a
                class="DD"
                href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/LoanTypes/ARM.php">Our
                ARM Loan Types</a> page.</dd>
<dt>Amortization</dt>
<dd>Repayment of loan by
                installment payments. As the payments are made,
                the debt is reduced so that at the end of fixed
                period or term, no money will be owed.</dd>
<dt>Annual Percentage<br />Rate (APR)</dt>
<dd>The annual percentage rate
                refers to the total cost of the loan, expressed
                as a yearly rate. For more detailed information,
                view the <a class="DD"
                href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/Answers/APRAnswers.php">APR</a>
                page.&nbsp;</dd>
<dt>Application Fee</dt>
<dd>That part of the closing costs
                pre-paid to the lender at time of application to
                cover initial expenses. We never charge for
                applications. A more upfront method is to request
                that the borrower directly cover the $15 expense
                of running a credit report.</dd>
<dt>Appraisal</dt>
<dd>A report made by a licensed
                and qualified person as to the value of a
                property as of a given date.</dd>
<dt>Assessed Value</dt>
<dd>The value placed on a piece of
                real estate by the taxing authority for the
                purpose of taxation. Also called an assessment.</dd>
<dt>Assumption of<br />Mortgage</dt>
<dd>The purchaser takes over
                mortgage payments for the balance of the loan,
                assuming primary liability. Unless specifically
                released by the lender, the seller remains
                secondarily liable.

<a class="DD" href="#Top">Back to Top</a></dd>
<dt>Balloon Mortgage</dt>
<dd>A mortgage with periodic
                payments that do not fully amortize the loan. The
                outstanding balance of the mortgage is due in a
                lump sum at the end of the term. See <a
                class="DD"

                Balloon Loan Type</a> page.</dd>
<dt><a name="Bankruptcy"></a>Bankruptcy</dt>
<dd>Bankruptcy is a legal
                declaration of the inability to repay debts.
                Bankruptcy should be viewed as a last resort. It
                will have a severe impact on a credit rating and
                will remain on a credit report for ten years.
                Furthermore, bankruptcy is not a solution in all
                cases. Federal student loans, Federal tax debt
                and child support are all exempt from bankruptcy
                protection. Bankruptcy agreements vary but there
                are two types of agreements that most people
                choose: <a class="DD"
                href="#Chapter7">Chapter 7</a> and <a
                class="DD" href="#Chapter13">Chapter
                13</a>.</dd>
<dt><a name="BridgeLoan"></a>Bridge
                Loan</dt>
<dd>A short-term loan secured by
                the equity in an as-yet-unsold house, with the
                funds to be used for a down payment and/or
                closing costs on a new house. There is no payment
                of principal until the house is sold or the end
                of the loan term, whichever comes first. Interest
                payments may or may not be deferred until the
                house is sold.</dd>
<dt>Buy down</dt>
<dd>Often called a step down
                payment, an interest rate buy down works with the
                current market rates. It works by having money
                advanced by an individual (e.g. builder, seller,
                buyer, lender, developer) to lower monthly
                mortgage payments for a few years or the whole
                term. See <a class="DD"

                Buydown Loan</a> page.

<dt><a class="DT" name="Cap">Cap</a><br />(interest rate)</dt>
<dd>The maximum interest rate
                increase allowable on an adjustable rate
                mortgage. Does not result in negative
                amortization.</dd>
                <dd>Initial adjustment caps,
                periodic adjustment caps, and lifetime caps make
                up an adjustable rate mortgage's <em>cap
                structure</em>, and are usually represented as
                three numbers, such as 1/2/6, which means that
                the initial adjustment cap is one percent, the
                periodic cap is two percent, and the lifetime cap
                is six percent.</dd>
                <dd><h4>Initial Adjustment Cap</h4></dd>
                <dd>An <em>initial adjustment cap</em> limits how
                much your interest rate can change at the first
                adjustment period. So if your adjustable rate
                mortgage has a one percent initial adjustment
                cap, your interest rate can only increase or
                decrease by a maximum of one percent at the first
                adjustment period.</dd>
                <dd><h4>Periodic Adjustment Cap</h4></dd>
                <dd>A <em>periodic adjustment cap</em> limits how
                much your interest rate can change from one
                adjustment period to the next. Usually a six
                month adjustable rate mortgage will have a one
                percent periodic adjustment cap while a one year
                adjustable rate mortgage will have a two percent
                periodic adjustment cap. So if your loan has a
                two percent periodic adjustment cap, your
                interest rate can only increase or decrease by a
                maximum of two percent per adjustment period.</dd>
                <dd><h4>Lifetime Cap</h4></dd>
                <dd>A <em>lifetime cap</em> sets the maximum and
                minimum interest rate that you can be charged for
                the life of the loan. Lifetime caps vary by
                lender, but most adjustable rate loans have caps
                of five or six percent above the initial interest
                rate. So if your loan has a six percent lifetime
                cap, your interest rate can only increase or
                decrease by a maximum of six percent for the life
                of the loan.</dd>
<dt>Cap<br />(payment rate)</dt>
<dd>The maximum payment amount
                increase allowable on an adjustable rate
                mortgage. May result in negative amortization.

<dt>Certificate Of Title</dt>
<dd>A statement that shows
                ownership of property, stating that the seller
                has clear legal title.</dd>
<dt><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</dt>
<dd>Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy,
                you petition the court to be freed from all your
                debts following the liquidation of almost all
                your assets. Certain assets, like your house, are
                usually exempt from liquidation. See <a
                class="DD"
                href="#Bankruptcy">Bankruptcy</a>.</dd>
<dt><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</dt>
<dd>In a Chapter 13 agreement, the
                court creates a debt repayment plan that allows
                the filer to keep their property. In order to
                file Chapter 13, a person must have a source of
                income and promise to pay part of their income to
                creditors. The court allows the filer to keep any
                assets that have debts against them if they pay
                them off under terms determined by the court. See

                class="DT" name="Closing">Closing</a></dt>
<dd>The concluding day of the real
                estate transaction, when title and deed pass from
                seller to buyer, the buyer signs the mortgage and
                pays the purchase price and closing costs. When
                you refinance, the signing of the new mortgage
                and paying all associated costs is called
                closing. See <a
href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/Answers/Closing.php">Closing
Overview</a> for more information.</dd>
<dt>Closing Costs</dt>
<dd>Expenses (over and above the

<dd>Stands for Cost Of Funds <a class="DD"
                href="GlossaryIL.php#Index">Index</a>. The 11th
                District cost-of-funds index (COFI) is a popular
                index for adjustable-rate mortgages because the
                index follows (lags) changes in market interest
                rates. It reflects the average interest paid by
                savings institutions in the 11th District for
                their various sources of funds over a specified
                period of time.&nbsp;</dd>

                percentage of the sales price or flat fee.</dd>
<dt>Commitment</dt>

                conditions.</dd>
<dt>Comparable</dt>
<dd>Refers to similar properties
                used for comparison purposes in the appraisal
                process. These properties will be reasonably the
                same size and location, with similar amenities
                and characteristics, so that the approximate fair
                market value of the subject property can be

<dd>The ratio of monthly debt
                payments to monthly gross income. Lenders use a
                housing DTI ratio (house payment divided by
                monthly income) and a total DTI ratio (total debt
                payments including the house payment divided by
                monthly income) to determine whether a borrower's
                income qualifies him or her for a mortgage.<br />
                <br />
                Front Ratio: The total mortgage payment including
                principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI)
                as well as any condominium or homeowner
                association fees divided by your total GROSS
                income. For the best interest rates this ratio
                should be below 28%. Example: With a gross income
                of $3700 per month, a total mortgage payment
                (PITI) of $973, the front ratio would be 26%.<br
                />
                <br />
                Back Ratio: The total mortgage payment PLUS any
                car payments, credit card and any other loan
                payments divided by your total GROSS income.
                Traditionally must be below 36% but could be as
                high as 55%. Example: With a gross income of
                $3700 per month, a total mortgage payment of
                $973, a car payment of $212, 1 credit card
                payment of $59 and 1 credit card payment of $43
                for a total of $1287 with a back ratio of 35%.</dd>
