	<p>When You hold title to real property (a fancy way
	of referring to home ownership) you must declare <i>how</i> you own it.
	Is it owned by one or more person, and what relationship do co-owners
	have with one another? Is it owned in a trust account (which has tax
	implications)? Perhaps home ownership is in the form of a lease-purchase
	agreement. In that case, who actually owns the property during the
	lease period?</p>
	<p>There are two basic ways title to property is held. The first is title
	held individually, referred to as "sole ownership." The owner could be a</p>
</div><div class="RC" id="right">
	<span class="Frag">natural person, a corporation, partnership, LLC or trust.</span>
	<p>The other way is title held by two or more persons or entities.  If two
	or more people (or entities) hold title to the same property at the same
	time, it is referred to as "concurrent ownership."</p>

	<p>The county recorder's office or county clerk's
	office keeps track of these types of legal documents. Your tax advisor
	and/or real estate attorney, if you have one, can offer you additional
	guidance, but here are the six most common ways that title is held:</p></div></div>
<br style="clear:left;"><br /><br />
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">AdjustHeight('text', 'left', 'right');</script>
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>A single man / woman - a person not
			legally married (e.g. John Doe, a single man)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>An unmarried man / woman - A person who has been married
			and is now legally divorced (e.g. John Doe, an unmarried man)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A married man / woman, as his sole and
			separate&nbsp; property - A person may wish to acquire
			property alone. The spouse must give consent, by
			quit-claim deed, to relinquish all rights, title,
			and interest in the property (e.g. John Doe, a married
			man, as his sole and separate property).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Community property - The Civil Code of
			most states define community property as property acquired
			by husband and wife, or either, during marriage, when
			not acquired as the separate property of either. Real
			property conveyed to a married person is presumed to
			be community property unless otherwise stated.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Joint tenancy - A joint interest is
			one owned by two or more people in equal shares. The
			key point is the right to survivorship. When one joint
			tenant dies, title is immediately vested to the
			surviving joint tenant.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Tenants in common - Unlike joint
			tenancy, co-owners own undivided interests, but
			unlike joint tenancy, the interests do not have to be
			equal in quantity or duration, and may arise from
			different times. There is no right of survivorship: each
			tenant own an interest which on his or her death vests in
			his or her heirs or devisees.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div><div id="text2"><div class="LC" id="left2" style="width:46%;padding-top:8px;border-top:3px solid #93c;">
<p>Other ways of vesting title include:</p><ol>
<li><p>Corporation - A corporation is a legal entity, created under state law,
consisting of one or more shareholders but regarded under law as having an existence
and personality separate from such shareholders.</p></li>

<li><p>A partnership - A partnership is an association of two or more persons who can
carry on business for profit as co-owners, as governed by the Uniform Partnership Act.
A partnership may hold title to real property in the name of the partnership.</p></li>
<li><p>A Trust* - A trust is an arrangement whereby legal title to property is transferred
by the grantor to a person called a trustee, to be held and managed by that person for the
benefit of the people specified in the trust agreement, called the beneficiaries.</p>

<p>*In cases of corporate, partnership or trust ownership the title company will</p>
</div><div class="RC" id="right2" style="width:46%;padding-top:8px;border-top:3px solid #93c;">
<span class="Frag">require that
it be furnished legal documents so that it may satisfy itself as to ownership rights of
the parties to the transaction and any limitations which may exist on the sale, transfer or
encumbrance of the property. Required documents may include corporate articles and bylaws,
certificates of partnership and trust agreements.</span></li></ol>

	<p>Tell us how you'd like to hold title well before your closing. This way,
	all of the forms will be ready for you at signing.</p>
	<p>What to change the way title is held? If you own a home and are holding title
	together with someone else,
	let's use a married couple as an example, and want to change the way you've
	vested the property--perhaps you're divorcing--then one party can sign away
	their claim to ownership using a Quit Claim Deed. Only after the Quit Claim Deed is
	properly recorded by the County Clerk's office is the property vesting is changed.</p>

	<p>After the recording process is complete, the existing lender should also be notified
	to update the mortgage note, too.</p></div></div>
