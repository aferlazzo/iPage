		<h1>Home Buying Mistakes</h1>
		<p>The Eight Most Costly Mistakes Buyers Make And How to Avoid Them</p>
	</div>
<p>Buying a home is undoubtedly the biggest financial
decision most people ever make. At the same time, you are having to
deal with moving, another potentially life altering decision.
Getting caught up in the excitement of the moment is common, but it's
serious business too &ndash; and you deserve serious advice. You don't
know it but, in the next few minutes you're going to learn eight
commonly made home buying mistakes. Avoiding these mistakes will
save you thousands of dollars. It will also allow you to avoid
the anguish of making a home purchasing mistake.</p>

<h2 style='width:238px;'>1. Failing to have a plan</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>It is a lot harder to win a game, or any endeavor, without having a clear strategy, or game plan. With a
game plan, you will eliminate many of the headaches involved in
this complicated process. You need a clear plan when deciding
to buy a house. Avoiding the other 7 mistakes by better planning will make
your experience better from a number of perspectives.</p>
<p><span class='Highlight'>The first step is to evaluate your current situation.</span></p>
<p>If you currently own a home, will it be necessary to
sell before making another purchase? Most people are frightened of putting their home
on the market prior to knowing exactly where they'd be living next, but
that's exactly what you must do. Your real estate agent can help with strategies and marketing your home to sell quickly.</p>
<p>Are you renting? If so, how much time is left on your lease? You'll need
to review the consequences of breaking the lease if you don't want to or can't wait before buying.
Specifics regarding the location of the house and the desired amenities (number of bedrooms, a pool,
or garage size) should be decided on, too. Commute distance is yet another factor to consider.</p>

<p><span class='Highlight'>Next, determine what feature are important to have.</span></p>
<p>Write down desirable locations you would consider, an
acceptable price range, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and
any other amenities that are important to you. Be specific. Although you probably won't find a home
that offers every feature on your list, without a wish list it will be harder
to recognize a home that meets your expectations.</p>
<p>You might want to use the <a href="HomeBuyerChecklist.php">Home Buyer Checklist</a> when
you are out looking for your home. There are so many things to
think about when choosing a home--sales price, neighborhood,
distance to work, and other special features--that it is difficult to keep them all in your head.</p>

<p><span class='Highlight'>Tell others, like your realtor what's important to you.</span></p>
<p>It is a lot of work finding a new home. A competent
Realtor will look for homes that match your criteria. Using a realtor will
save you time and effort. You'll spend less time looking
at homes that don't fit your needs and desires. Some things to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A home which is too large or too small for future needs</li>
<li>A fixer-upper when you are not handy</li>
<li>A house that is too far from work or too close to traffic</li>
<li>A home in the wrong price range</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a plan will save you time and reduce the hassle of
shopping for a home. To summarize, spend a little time in up front
and save a lot of time and money in the future!</p>

<h2 style='width:439px;'>2. Not Realizing You Can Afford To Own a Home</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>Many people feel that home ownership is beyond their reach,
but affording a home has never been easier. As you will realize
after looking over this web site for a short time, home loan
programs are more flexible today than ever, and the tax laws continue to favor home
ownership like no other tax shelter.</p>
<p>Home ownership is an investment like no other.
Although no one can say if a specific home or community will
appreciate in value, generally speaking, the odds favor the homeowner.</p>
<p>Numerous unique tax advantages are available to home owners.
The thousands of dollars you pay in mortgage interest is tax
deductible. This tax deduction alone can sometimes make owning
your own home cheaper than renting with "after tax" take home
dollars.</p>
<p>We, at Lightning Mortgage, will be glad to

product to suit your specific needs.</p>

<h2 style='width:278px;'>3. Failing to get Pre-qualified</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>Most people don't realize how much they can afford. Sometimes
they spend hours searching for homes in a price range that is too
high or too low! Save time and money by getting pre-qualified for a mortgage.
Before you go shopping for a home, you must determine how much
you can afford.</p>
<p>Once you are pre-qualified for a mortgage, you
will know your buying power-you will save time by looking only in
your price range. The process is simple. We'll ask you basic questions
concerning your credit history, and determine your buying power.
<p>You can even get pre-approved for a loan! Imagine for a moment
that when you and your Realtor initially draft your offer for the
home you select, you are already approved for the loan &ndash; IN
ADVANCE. From the seller's perspective, it's as if you are an
all-cash buyer! By having this step done you will relieve stress
and worrying about qualifying.</p>
<p>In today's market, a pre-approval can be a powerful
negotiating tool. The old way of buying a home caused people like you
to spend a lot of time searching for the perfect home, carefully drafting an offer,
awaiting acceptance of the offer, consulting a Loan Officer, and
filling out the multitude of forms and applications. All the effort would
often go to waste because, for whatever reason, you'd be
turned down for the loan. You deserve peace of mind and
negotiating power by getting an approved loan before you make an
offer.</p>

<h2 style='width:408px;'>4. Failing to Find the Right Lender or Realtor</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>Most likely you don't rarely, if ever, interview people. Yet, in
order to find both the lender and the right Realtor (you'll need both),
you may need to interview several. The quality of your home buying experience is
dependent upon your skill at selecting the best-qualified
people.</p>
<p>In the real estate business, people who have helped buyers like you
buy and finance many homes usually cost about the same as others who
have less experience.
Bringing that experience to bear on your home purchase could mean a
lower price at the negotiating table, a faster close, better loan terms, as well as
experiencing much less purchasing hassles. Your lender should understand how to
find the right loan for your needs. Your agent should be a
skilled, win-win negotiator!</p>
<p>You need to select people who guarantee their services.
You should have the right to fire either the lender or the Realtor if you are not
satisfied - no questions asked.</p>
<p>Both lenders and agents make it their business to provide expert service
and advice through the entire process. The more
closely you work with your lender and agent, the better your needs are known
and the more effectively you can be served.</p>
<p>The purchase of your home could well be the most important
financial transaction you have ever made. The people you select
can make it a satisfying and profitable activity or a terrible
experience. It's your home. It's your money. Never hesitate to
ask questions.</p>

<h2 style='width:398px;'>5. Choosing a loan based only on loan type</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>One of the great modern-day myths is that a fixed rate
mortgage is the best mortgage type.</p>
<p>Many different types of loan programs are available. Refer to
<a href=
"http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/LoanTypes/LoanTypeDescriptions.php">
Our Loan Types</a>. It would be a great mistake to think that
just because "Aunt Sue got a 8.5% 30-year fixed rate" you should
get the same loan.</p>
<p>You should get together with an expert who can explain the
different types of loan programs. Each program may have its own
series of special benefits for you and your specific needs. When
considering such an important decision, it is best to explore all
possibilities. It may well be that a 30-year fixed rate is the
best type of loan program for you. It may also be that you can
save a significant amount of money by exploring alternative loan
programs.</p>
<p>A full-service lender like Lightning Mortgage with
relationships throughout the mortgage industry is a must in
today's market. Lenders need the flexibility of the small
business owner with the clout of a large company.</p>
<p>Today there are almost as many different programs as there are
housing options. A few considerations for choosing the right type
of mortgage are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipated time in the home</li>
<li>Available asset base</li>
<li>Current income situation vs. future income situation,
etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is wise to pick a loan program that fits YOUR lifestyle.</p>
<p>Example: If you pay off a loan in fifteen years versus thirty
years, you will obviously save a lot of money in interest
expense. It is important to note that this savings is because you
repay the loan in half the time. The savings is not due to a
significant savings in interest rates, but in interest paid.</p>
<p>You should expect that there would be a much lower interest
rate since the loan has a quicker repayment and, from any
lender's perspective, carries with it less risk. Yet the difference
in interest rate will not be that significant. Rates on 15-year
mortgages may be 1/4% to 3/8% better than 30-year mortgages. The
other important consideration is that monthly payments on 15-year
loans will be approximately 25% higher on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Another one of the great modern-day myths is that you should
go to your bank to get the best mortgage at the best interest
rate.</p>
<p>Typically a commercial bank will own a separate business
entity that shares the bank's name and offers mortgage financing.
But, this does not mean that you will get a 'special' deal just
because you are the bank's client. Each and every loan must stand
on its own merits and meet loan program guidelines.</p>
<p>The bank's mortgage subsidiary has no special access to your
financial records as you might expect. The bank's mortgage
subsidiary must request your financial records from the bank just
as any other mortgage company. Your mortgage loan process will
not be simplified or viewed differently from any other applicant
making a request.</p>
<p>The perception of most people who go to their bank's mortgage
subsidiary is that their loan payments will always be made to
their bank; thus, all of the individual's banking needs will be
"under one roof." The reality is that most mortgage subsidiaries
of banks sell their loans on the secondary mortgage market and
may sell your loan servicing, just as any other mortgage company
can.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is that a typical bank
mortgage subsidiary works with a small number of mortgage
products. You will seldom find a wide variety of loan programs,
and your loan officer may not have a good comprehension of all
the different programs available. It is doubtful that they can
adequately advise you as to the best program for your needs. It
is possible that you, or the property you are buying, may need to
have special underwriting to approve your loan application.</p>
<p>Just as you should interview your Realtor, you should also
interview your Lender. Not all lenders look after your needs.
Select a Lender (we, of course, hope it will be Lightning
Mortgage) who is willing to discuss your needs and help you
choose the loan program that is best for your situation, not the
best for the Lender!</p>

<h2 style='width:368px;'>6. Failing to make your own inspection</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>You probably would not want to rely on the seller to point out
defects in a house he is attempting to sell. There may even be
hidden problems of which he is unaware.</p>
<p>Be sure your sales contract is worded so that any "earnest
money deposit" must be returned in the event the house fails
inspection. If a major defect is found, you have the option to
cancel the contract and have your deposit returned, bargain for a
lower price to compensate for the cost of repairing the problem,
or have the owner make needed repairs before the sale closes.</p>
<p>Even before you get to the point of a contract and having a
professional inspector look at the house, there are many items
you can check yourself as you are shopping for a home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure: Basement, check the foundation for cracks or water
marks. Floors, are they level? Does the roof sag?</li>
<li>Water damage: Look for unevenly painted ceiling or wall;
mildew odor in basement; signs of re-plastering or re-tiling in
just one area of a room.</li>
<li>Water pressure: Flush toilet and turn on both hot- and
cold-water faucet at the same time to test.</li>
<li>Plumbing: Ask what type of pipes are installed and their age. If
applicable, ask when the septic system was last inspected and
cleaned. Stand near the tank to detect odor or soggy ground.</li>
<li>Wiring: A 100-amp system is typical in modern construction
and uses a one-inch main line; this can be seen leading to the
fuse box. Appliances such as drier or range require a 220-amp
line. Notice if lights flicker or don't work. Check for
electrical outlets . . . usually at least 2 in each room.</li>
<li>Energy efficiency: Ask to check last year's heating and
cooling bills. Determine if proper insulation has been used.</li>
<li>Pests: Be alert for small accumulations of sawdust in the
basement. This might indicate an insect problem. Obtain date and
results of the last wood-destroying pest inspection.</li>
<li>Ask to see the seller's survey made when the seller bought
the house. Make sure you read it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:#009">Home Buyer Checklist</h3>
<p>When you are shopping take a copies of the
<a href="HomeBuyerChecklist.php">Home Buyer Checklist</a> to keep
you alert to possible problem areas. The web page will print in black
and white for your convenience if you press the print button of your browser. Avoid
"surprises" by keeping your eyes open. A good realtor will point
them out to you. Be certain that you are clear on items that
would be your responsibility to correct and repairs the seller is
agreeing to make. Have this list with you when you go for your
walk-through. You can be successful in the home buying process.
During the entire process you should remember to buy with resale
in mind. In short, be alert! Be curious!</p>

<h2 style='width:568px;'>7. Failing to obtain a home inspection from a qualified inspector</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>A home inspector reports on the structural and mechanical
condition of every major part of the home. With this report you
will have the facts you need to make a decision about whether the
condition of the home suits your needs.</p>
<p>A well-qualified inspector who has adhered to federal
licensing standards can spot problems that you might not be able
to see. Expect problems to be clearly explained, repair expenses
closely calculated, maintenance costs estimated, and a written
report delivered within a day or two.</p>
<p>Most contracts are written conditional on the outcome of
several inspections. These inspections may include several items
including inspection for wood-boring insects, excessive amounts
of radon gas, structural soundness, and the condition of the
heating, wiring, roofing and plumbing.</p>
<p>When the contract is written, it should specify who would be
responsible for paying to correct problems that are uncovered by
the results of any of these inspections.</p>
<p>If the purchase contract is well written, home inspections can
create a safety valve for both the buyer and seller. If poorly
written, the result can be heartbreak or lawsuits.</p>
<p>Your Realtor should be very familiar with the local laws and
customs regarding home inspections. Many people have made costly
mistakes about purchases because their agent failed to comprehend
this crucial report.</p>

<div style='margin:0 auto;width:400px;'>
<b class="top"><b class="b1"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b4"></b></b>
<h2 style='width:398px;'>8. Not knowing your rights and obligations</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

<p>Real estate law is extensive and complex. The contract for
sale and purchase is a legally binding document. An improperly
written contract can cause the sale to fall through or cost you
thousands of dollars for repairs, inspections, and remedies for
title defects.</p>
<p>You must be certain which repairs and closing costs are your
responsibility. You must know whether the property can legally be
sold "as is" and how deed restrictions and local zoning will
affect the transaction. If there are defects in the title, or if
the property is in conflict with local restrictions, you or your
Realtor must remedy them. Otherwise, you could lose
thousands!</p>
<p>It is your Realtor's job to know the laws governing real
estate transactions. They are involved in an on-going training
program to keep up to date with these laws.</p>
<p>You deserve to have an agent who is not only knowledgeable
about the transaction but is also willing to educate you
throughout the process so you will feel more comfortable.</p>
<p><span class='Highlight'>To turn the negative around, here's what you should do:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't buy a home on a whim. Have a plan.</li>
<li>Learn about the tax benefits of home ownership, giving you
greater buying power.</li>
<li>Get pre-approved for a mortgage with a great lender like
Lightning Mortgage.</li>
<li>Find a good realtor to help you, guide you, and protect
you.</li>
<li>Look at all your mortgage options and pick the best one for
your situation, not simply the safest or most costly one.</li>
<li>Use the attached <a href="HomeBuyerChecklist.php">Checklist</a>
to help you make the best decision of which home to buy.</li>
<li>Obtain a home inspection by a licensed inspector.</li>
