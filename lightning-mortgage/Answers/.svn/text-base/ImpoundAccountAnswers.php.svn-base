	<p>An impound account (also known as an escrow account) is an account
	that's set up for you by your lender to collect funds from you that are
	used to pay future property tax bills and hazard insurance premiums. Its
	the &quot;TI&quot; in &quot;<a href="GlossaryMP.php#PITI">PITI</a>.&quot;</p>

	<p>After closing, you'll pay one-twelfth of your insurance premium and
	property tax bill to the lender each month along with your principal
	and interest payment. The lender is then responsible for paying
	your property tax bill and hazard insurance premium when they come
	due. An impound account is almost always required if the
	borrower makes a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price.&nbsp;
	This requirement will vary from lender to lender.</p>

	<p>Money is collected from the borrower at closing to set up the
	impound account. This amount will vary depending on what month of
	the year you close. If the property tax bill was recently paid
	and the next installment isn't due for some time, the amount required to
	start the impound account will be less than it'll be if the property
	taxes need to be paid in the near future. The amount collected at
	closing will usually be enough to cover several months worth of taxes
	and insurance.</p>

	<p>Although most people prefer not to have an impound account unless it's
	required, some people prefer having one because it relieves them of the
	obligation to pay taxes and hazard bills as they come due. We'll
	advise you to take advantage of an impound account. An impound account
	is a good idea if you're on a tight budget, or if you've had difficulty

	managing your money in the past. Even if an impound
	account isn't required, the lender usually gives you the option at
	closing of having one if you want it. But the news gets even better.</span>

	<p>Some states now require lenders to pay interest on the amount held in
	escrow.&nbsp;In addition, the 1990 Housing Bill recently signed into law
	by the President, requires lenders to issue itemized statements of escrow
	accounts to borrowers on an annual basis. While many lenders are already providing
	homeowners with regular statements of their escrow accounts, the law ensures that
	every lender follows this practice.</p>

	<p>The irony of the impound account is that it's required of borrowers
	who have the least amount of money to put down. Most cash-strapped
	first-time buyers have difficulty scraping together enough money for a
	down payment, plus closing costs. This is precisely the
	situation where lenders insist on an impound account, which adds to the
	amount of cash the buyer will need at closing.</p>

	<p>There is another way to get around this cash-on-hand requirement.&nbsp;
	Many lenders will waive the impound account requirement if the borrower
	puts slightly more than 10% down. For example, if you can
	put enough cash down to equal 10.1% of the purchase price, you can
	probably avoid having an impound account.</p>

	<p>If you do end up with an impound account, be sure to carefully monitor
	the payment of your property taxes and insurance premiums. Lenders do
	occasionally make mistakes.</p>
