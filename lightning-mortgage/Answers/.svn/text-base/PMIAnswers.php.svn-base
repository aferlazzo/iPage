	<h1>What is PMI?</h1>
	<p>PMI or Private Mortgage Insurance (known by a few aliases: PMI, MI, MIP) is required by
	some lenders when you buy a house with less than 20% down or refinance
	an existing mortgage resulting in more than an 80% <a
	 href="GlossaryIL.php#Loan-To-Value Ratio">LTV</a>.
	Mortgage insurance is a type of guarantee that helps protect lenders
	against the costs of foreclosure. It enables lenders to accept lower down
	payments than they would normally accept. In effect, mortgage insurance
	provides what the equity of a higher down payment would provide to cover a
	lender's losses in the unfortunate event of foreclosure.</p>

	<p>The cost of PMI increases as your down payment
	decreases. <em>Example</em>: The cost of PMI on a 10% down payment is less
	than the cost of PMI on a 5% down payment. Your PMI premium is normally
	added to your monthly mortgage payment.</p>

	<p>Statistics show that half of all home mortgage loans have PMI policies
	associated with them. One alternative from paying PMI is taking out a
	piggyback loan. In a piggyback loan scenario a first mortgage is for 80%
	LTV and a second mortgage is for the 5-20% LTV, depending on the amount of
	down payment.</p>
	<h1>Can I get rid of the PMI?</h1>

	<p>The decision on when to cancel the private insurance
	coverage does not depend solely on the amount of equity in your home.
	The final say on terminating a private mortgage-insurance policy is
	reserved jointly for the lender and any investor who may have purchased
	an interest in the mortgage. However, in most cases, the lender will allow
	cancellation of mortgage insurance when the loan is paid down to 80% of
	the original property value. Some lenders may require that you pay PMI
	for one or two years before you may apply to remove it.</p>

	<p>Contact your lender to see about canceling the PMI
	on your loan. In most cases, an appraisal will be required to
	determine the value of your property. You will probably also be required to
	pay for the cost of this appraisal. Another way of canceling PMI is to
	refinance and to get a new loan without PMI.</p>
	<p>We have many alternatives to paying PMI. See our <a
