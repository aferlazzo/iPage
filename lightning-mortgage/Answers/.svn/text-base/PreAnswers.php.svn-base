				<h1>How Important Is</h1>
				<p>Being Pre-Qualified or Pre-Approved</p>
			</div>
<div id="text" style='height:570px;'><div class="LC" id="left">
	<p>You sometimes will hear the terms 'pre-qualify' and 'pre-approve'
	being used interchangeably. But in fact, there are big differences
	between being pre-qualified for a mortgage and pre-approved for a mortgage.&nbsp;</p>

	<p><img src="../images/Bolt/StudentFront.gif" alt="Bolt" onMouseover="this.style.display='none'"
	style="vertical-align:middle;float:left;padding-right:.5em">Being pre-qualified for a mortgage
	essentially means the you've made an online application for
	pre-qualification. Generally speaking, you have provided your
	income, your debts, your assets and have requested a credit report be
	run. We'll then review your credit history, compute your debt-to-income
	ratio <i>based on the information provided</i> and then give you a nod
	to pre-qualification. This pre-qualification is subject to all
	information being verified and found <i>satisfactory</i> to a lender. This is where potential
	problems will usually occur. For instance, if you provided information
	about your income that seemed right, but the lender calculates the income
	a different way (usually in the case of self-employed or commissioned
	individuals), the income will not hold up and the loan can possibly be
	rejected.</p>

	<p>Or, let's say you provided a dollar amount to be used
	for down payment and closing costs but you don't actually have the cash. Perhaps
	you've been promised a gift from your parents. You might think
	the money would simply be counted as yours, but the lender doesn't accept gifts as a source of
	 funds.</p>
</div><div class="RC" id="right"><p>
	The loan could ultimately be rejected. Keep in mind, pre-qualification is a step in the
	right direction, but it is only a step.</p>

</blockquote>
	<p style='text-align:left;'>Pre-approval, on the other hand, will actually take
	you through all necessary verification to support the loan
	application.</p><p style='text-align:left;'>This generally includes bank statements, pay stubs, W2 forms
	and credit report. When the lender issues a pre-approval, it is an
	actual <i>approval</i>. It's like money in your pocket, subject
	only to the you finding an acceptable property within the pre-approved
	price range and having a satisfactory appraisal completed. Of course,
	problems could still crop up with the appraisal, but a pre-approval is a
	much stronger and more certain a position. Lenders we work with are
	happy to issue a pre-approval within a few hours to a few days of loan
	application.&nbsp;</p>

	today. Fact: Knowing you have the financing aspect of the home buying
	event out of the way will make the purchase process much less stressful.</p>
