	<p>Before we discuss the topic at
	hand please
	allow me put the subject in context. You've
	filled out application. You're tired of answering
	questions. In fact you want to ask some of your
	own. Do you qualify for a loan and if so, at what
	interest rate?&nbsp;</p>

	<p>We answer all those questions,
	in writing. To the best of our ability given the
	information you provide, we'll send you a written
	estimate. This standard form has the 'creative'
	name of <i>Good Faith Estimate</i>, or
	GFE.&nbsp;But be careful when comparison shopping
	for a loan. Some less ethical mortgage brokers, loan officers,
	and the non-standard treatment of terminology by
	lenders, makes the road from what is on the GFE
	to the items that ultimately go on the HUD-1 form
	appear to be a shell-game. Some lenders charge a
	bunch of separate little fees. Others charge
	fewer, but larger, fees. How do you make sense of
	it all?</p>

	<p>What I like best are 'No Cost'
	loans. Despite what you may have been led to
	believe, there is no such thing as 'No Cost'
	loan. In fact, for every loan transaction there
	many professions--governmental and licensed
	private agencies--involved. Each activity has an
	associated cost. These costs are estimated on the
	GFE. The actual charges will be documented on the
	<a
	href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/Answers/HUD1Explained.php">HUD-1
	Form</a> you'll sign at closing.</p>
	<p>If we don't have all the
	information, our estimate is not going to be as
	accurate as it would be if we had all the facts
	at the beginning of the loan process. You've
	heard the expression, &quot;garbage in, garbage
	out,&quot; haven't you? It certainly applies
	here.</p>

	<p>Let's assume for the moment
	that all the information you provide is correct.
	Here are most common items found in the
	GFE.&nbsp;Prepaid items in Section 1000 are not
	considered to be part of closing costs. They are
	often included on GFE reports to show you a
	complete picture of your costs.</p>

	<p>Also, be aware of the tax
	implications of these charges. Many are tax
	deductible. See the <a

	href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/InterestRates/EducationTaxes.htm">Tax
	Advantages of Home Ownership</a> for more
	information.</p>

	<p>In summary, the variables from
	lender-to-lender, missing information from you,
	the&nbsp; borrower, and the fact that the same
	items may not appear on everyone's GFE often make
	it impossible to obtain the true cost of a loan.
	We here at Lightning Mortgage make every attempt
	to provide Good Faith Estimates that are as
	accurate as possible. We try to avoid surprises
	at the closing table at all costs!</p>
