<div id="Big"><h1>HUD-1 Closing Statement</h1></div>
</div>
<div id="Registered" style="display:block;">
<p>As a point of reference,
closing costs are costs associated with the loan
closing, while settlement charges are the whole
enchilada--everything. In addition to closing
costs, there's pre-paid interest, escrow reserves
for taxes and insurance, and the down payment (if
the loan is a for a home purchase).&nbsp; Closing
costs and settlement charges are estimated on the
Good Faith Estimate (<a

href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/Answers/GFEExplained.php">GFE</a>)
and finalized on the HUD-1 document at the
closing.</p>

<div style="float:left;width:49%;"><p>Truth be known, the HUD-1,
also known as the Real Estate Settlement
Statement, is a document that is rarely read all
the way through by most borrowers. Is it because
the government-issued form reminds us too much of
doing our taxes? Is it because the amounts listed
are higher than most people's annual
salary?&nbsp;</p></div>
<div style="float:right;width:49%;">
<p style="text-align:center;">Our past clients say...
<br />
<div id="Testimonial" class="Testimonial">
    ..great things about us. Here are just a few.
</div></div><br style="clear:both;">

    <script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript">var RowOnPage=0;</script>

<p>Or perhaps by the time we're
faced with signing this document we just want to
get it over with and get back to our normal life?
Whatever the reason, we can at least all agree
that our eyes glaze over when we look at mostly
empty numbered lines, often referring to other
lines, printed out on legal-sized paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have no fear, my friend. Most
of the same information will have already been
presented to you with your original <a

href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/Answers/GFEExplained.php">Good
Faith Estimate</a>. The line numbers on the Good
Faith Estimate (GFE) and the HUD-1 correspond.
The major difference between the GFE and HUD-1
forms is the GFE form has estimated amounts while
to HUD-1 form contains the exact amounts. The
HUD-1 form also contains line items not found on
the GFE, referring to amounts paid to and by the
seller, and those fees paid on behalf of the
borrower.</p>
<p>As with most government
&quot;standardization&quot; efforts, the original
plan for one form has evolved into several forms,
depending on specific loan parameters. Doubtful?
Just think of how many tax return forms we're
faced with. To think it all began with one simple
form! For this reason the line numbers on your
form may be slightly different than those listed
below. What will remain constant are the major
section groupings.</p>
<p>One last point. Keep in mind
the tax implications of these charges. Many are
tax deductible. See <a

href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/InterestRates/EducationTaxes.htm">the
tax advantages of homeownership</a> for more
information.</p>

                month.&nbsp; Most mortgage companies use a 15 day
                estimate.&nbsp; If you close early in the month
                you will owe more interest, if you close later
                you will owe less. Please keep in mind that you
                will have one month without a mortgage payment
