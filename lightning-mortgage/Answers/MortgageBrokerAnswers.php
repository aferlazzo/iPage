	<p>In the past 20 years, independent mortgage brokers
	like me have had a significant positive impact on the lending
	industry. Today the use of a professional mortgage broker is one
	of the key strategies used by sophisticated borrowers like you.</p>

	<p>A Home Mortgage Study by J.D. Power and Associates of more than
	11,000 home mortgage customers ranked their experience with mortgage
	brokers more satisfied than those who obtained loans directly from lenders.
	Although slightly fewer than one-third of mortgage shoppers used a broker
	to help them find their current mortgage, those customers who did use a
	broker tend to be very satisfied with the lending experience, according to
	the study, released in November, 2004.</p>
</div><div class="RC" id="right">

	<p>Among the consumers who responded to the survey, 29 percent indicate that
	they contacted a broker to help them find their current mortgage. Those
	customers who used a broker tend to be substantially more satisfied with the
	broker personnel compared with those who interfaced directly with the lender's
	personnel.</p>

	<p>"Brokers appear to perform significantly better in meeting customer
	expectations," said Jeremy Bowler, director of the finance and insurance
	practice at J.D. Power and Associates. "Brokers are perhaps more dependent
	on customer referrals than the direct lenders. As a result, brokers may be
	more in tune with the cause and effect of customer satisfaction and advocacy."</p>

<h2 style='width:678px;'>What's the Difference between a Mortgage Broker and a Direct Lender?</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

	<p>As your mortgage broker, I will counsel you on the
	loans available from different lenders, take your application, and
	process the loan. A lender has only a small number of loan programs. This
	excludes many borrowers. As mortgage broker, I deal with hundreds of
	lenders. I can find the lenders who specialize in various market niches
	that many other lenders avoid, such as loans to applicants with poor
	credit ratings, loans to borrowers who do not intend to occupy the
	property, loans with minimal or no down payment, and so on.</p>

<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

	<p>Unless you are a very astute shopper who is willing to
	contact hundreds of lenders and enjoys devoting a lot of time to the
	task of evaluating different mortgage programs, you will probably do better
	dealing with a mortgage broker. Mortgage brokers do not add any net
	cost to the lending process, because they perform functions that would
	otherwise have to be done by employees of the lender. Furthermore,
	because mortgage brokers deal with multiple lenders -- in a typical
	case, 25 to 30, sometimes more -- they can shop for the best terms
	available on any given day.&nbsp;Lightning Mortgage deals
	with over 130 lenders.</p>

<h2 style='width:288px;'>What is a Mortgage Broker?</h2>
<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

	<p>A mortgage broker is an independent real estate
	financing professional who specializes in the origination of
	residential mortgage loans. Mortgage brokers normally pass the actual
	funding and servicing of loans on to &quot;Wholesale Lending
	Sources.&quot; As your mortgage broker I'll combine my professional
	expertise with direct access to hundreds of loan products. This is
	how I provide the most efficient way to obtain financing tailored to your
	specific financial goals.</p>

<b class="bottom"><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></b></div>

	<p>In the volatile home-lending market, I can serve as
	your personal financial &quot;policeman,&quot; offering you
	security, safety, and peace of mind. One of my most important functions is
	escorting your loan application through the entire process,
	constantly patrolling the component transactions for possible breakdowns.
	I do this by wading through the mountains of rate data and program
	options, researching current market conditions to find the most accurate
	and up-to-date information about cost-effective loan options. See this
	<a href="./MortgageHiccups.php">List of Potential Pitfalls</a> we
	navigate through.</p>

	<p>There are literally thousands of variables that
	can affect the outcome of your mortgage transaction. That's why you
	need a mortgage broker like me to act as liaison between the title and
	escrow company, real estate agent, lender, appraiser, credit agency, the
	underwriters, the processors, attorneys, and any other services
	which may effect your transaction. I will also:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Discuss and explain financing program options</li>
		<li>Inform you, in writing, of lock-in options</li>
		<li>Explain all documents of the loan application</li>
		<li>Explain all associated costs of the loan application</li>
		<li>Explain the disbursement of all loan applications</li>
		<li>Explain the loan process, from application to closing</li>
		<li>Provide you with a good faith estimate of cost and fees</li>
		<li>Communicate with you throughout the loan process in a timely manner</li>
		<li>Coordinate the final closing of your transaction</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your next question may be how to choose which mortgage broker to use? Do you use
	the one closest to your neighborhood or do you choose one based on they way they work?</p>
