	<p>Obtaining the best mortgage loan is more than a matter
	of luck and finding the right broker, although it sure does help (See <a
		href="MortgageHiccups.php">Mortgage Hiccups</a>). Some of
	the factors affecting your ability to obtain a loan at the best possible
	interest rate:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Your application: Fill out the application fully and
			completely. You don't want surprises to pop up when the
			information is verified.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Debt-to-income ratio: How much of your income is spent on paying
			existing bills?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Down payment (purchases) or Home equity
			(refinances): how much you owe compared to the current worth of your home.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Liquid reserves: You've saved up to purchase the home. But you
			still need to keep some reserves for a &quot;rainy day.&quot;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Occupancy type: Primary home, second home, or an investment
			(rental)</p>
		</li></ol>
</div>
<div class="RC" id="right">
		<ol start=6><li>
			<p>Home type: A single family home
			represents less risk to lenders than multi-family dwellings, so they will
			increase interest rates</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Credit History: Currents debts and payment history, particularly
			on your mortgage payments.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Delinquent Accounts: A pattern of paying
			bills 30 or more days late will cause your interest rate to go up.</p>
		</li><li>
			<p>Recent Credit Inquiries: Every time
			your credit report is checked, a note of this activity is kept. It is best
			not to try refinancing at the same time you are buying a new car, applying for credit
			cards, and buying jewelry using an installment plan.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Public records (liens and judgments), foreclosures,
			accounts turned to collection companies are negative factors affecting your
			ability to borrow.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In the lender's eyes, it's all about finding ways to
	minimize the risk that a mortgage won't be repaid.</p>
