					<p>The average person starts
					out with a system of accounting consisting of
					putting their ATM card into the machine until the
					money stops coming out. When that happens, they
					duck and cover. &quot;Sooner or later it would
					all work out and everyone will get their
					money,&quot; or so the thinking goes.</p><p>Those
					credit cards that were so easily pulled out when
					it came time to pay for a purchase were not so
					easily paid off when the bill came in the mail. If you're like most
					people who tend to operate this way, you'll find
					yourself getting denied for additional credit
					cards, car loans, and other forms of credit.</p>

					<p>You'll discover that somehow everyone seems to know about the
					dentist bill that didn't get paid. That's when you begin to realize that
					someone is keeping track of your credit history,
					and it's boiled down into something called a credit score.</p>
					<p>These scores affect your loan in the form of which loan programs you can
					qualify for, the ability to get a good interest rate
					and the points you will pay. You may wonder
					whether your credit score is accurate. In most
					cases it is. This section explains credit scores
					and has links to web pages jammed with tips on how to
					improve your score and correct mistakes on the report.</p>

					lender cannot delete credit information once it is in one or more of the credit reporting
					agencies. This must be done directly by the borrower. See <a
