<p>In the course of doing business we frequently talk with customers who are
very&nbsp; reluctant to believe the straight-forward way we do business. Later we
find out that they've fallen victim to a bait-and-switch scheme. There are many variations
of mortgage financing bait-and-switch schemes. Hopefully you will avoid falling in one of these
traps by learning about one common form.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font:bold medium Verdana; color: #005800;">We're going fishing!</p>
<p>Have you seen a newspaper ad that read, &quot;3.99% Interest Rate&quot;?
That's the idea. The ad says more, but that's all they want you to remember. That, and their phone
number. This is the &quot;bait.&quot; So you call the loan originator (broker, bank, or another
lending institution) and make an appointment to get your &quot;3.99&quot; rate.</p>
<p>The bait has done its job. You, their new customer, are in the door and have
filled out an application. Isn't that a lovely office? A nice woman offers you coffee or a soft
drink. You feel great. This is how they set the hook. While you're filling out an application you keep
remembering that sign that said 3.99%. No one has told you don't qualify for that rate. In fact,
only a select few can qualify for that loan program. But they don't tell you much of anything
other than they need to order your appraisal that you'll need to pay for it.</p>
<p>After some additional pleasantries, you are told they will be in touch.
So you go home feeling great about life. A few days later, you call back to check on your
refinance. That's when they tell you the bad news. You don't qualify for that rate. In fact,
you barely qualify for a loan at all. Right now, they have a special promotion, and if you act now
they can fit you into the loan program. This is the &quot;switch.&quot; You agree in a hurry, and
rush right down with your required financial documents in hand, all because you've been told
that this is the only program that will work for you. Unfortunately, they failed to mention the
steep prepayment penalty or the high interest rate. Those surprises will be sprung on you at
the closing table, after your bags are packed, and the movers are backing into your driveway.
When it's too late to change anything.</p>
<blockquote class="PullQuote" style="width:50%;">
     Don't do business with unethical mortgage brokers, We have a better way.
</blockquote>
<p>There is a better way, and you've found it. You've reached this website.
It's filled with information about mortgages. We don't make promises we can't deliver. The
experience is completely different. First, we provide you with ample information here on our
site before you decide to apply. After you look around and digest some of the information, you
decide that you'd like to find out more. Now take the first step. Fill out an
<a class="Index" href="../MortgageApplication/LoanAppShort.php">application</a>.
That's a good thing, but you also need to follow through and order your credit report.</p>
</div><div class="RC" id="right">
<p>You may already know your credit score. That's helpful, but scores change every
day. With three separate credit reporting agencies we need to know all your scores, not
just one. Besides, there are more than just credit scores on a credit report. It is this
other information that sometimes will make a difference to whether or not you qualify for a
loan. For example, many times there will be another person with the same name on your report.
This person's credit history may be pulling down your score. See
<a href="../CreditScores.php">Credit Scores</a> for lots of helpful information.</p>
<p>With the application and credit report we have a nearly complete picture. You
also have an opportunity to provide us with more specific information on the <a
href="../MortgageApplication/LoanAppShort.php">application</a>
in the &quot;Situation&quot; text box.</p>
<blockquote class="PullQuote">

</blockquote>
<p>Once we do an initial review of your application we'll contact you at the time
you specify is most convenient on your application. When we call, we'll get to know you
and listen to your specific needs because we consider you to be more than just numbers and
words in a file. You are a living, breathing person with challenges and responsibilities. You
took that leap of faith and provided us with your financial information. Our job is to become your
financial advisor. Our goal is to offer you the best of everything--from service to rates.</p>
<p>Here at Lightning Mortgage, we have hundreds of <a href="../LoanTypes.php">loan
programs</a>. We are licensed mortgage brokers who run interference with these
many lenders for you. It is our job to find the
best loans that meets your specific needs. If
there are several, we'll provide you with choices
and options. You are the decision maker. Our role
is to make you aware of your options and to
advise you. With that said, if there is a 3.99%
interest rate loan that you qualified for based
on your credit history and other financial
information, we'd be happy to offer it to you.</p>
<p>Your <a
href="../InterestRates.php">interest
rate</a> is based on several factors. Mortgage
(or rental) payment history is very important.
You must continue to keep your mortgage paid
until your new loan closes and funds. Otherwise,
your credit rating will suffer. In fact, we ask
you to sign a document called <i>The Ten
Commandments Of Mortgage Lending </i>at the
beginning of the financing process. It lists ten
items that can and will cause your loan to be in
jeopardy if not followed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you like our philosophy and
appreciate doing business with a company that
will treat you with respect, give you honest
answers, and be upfront with you, then please <a
class="Index" href="../MortgageApplication/LoanAppShort.php">apply today</a>.
If you have been a victim of a bait-and-switch
mortgage scheme and would like to tell us your
story, please&nbsp; <a

about it</a>.</p></div></div>
