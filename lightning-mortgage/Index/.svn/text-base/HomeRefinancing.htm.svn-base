                    <p>Made Easy With Good Credit or Bad Credit</p>
                </div>

                <div id="text">
                    <div class="LC" id="left">
                        <p>In this section we will cover some key questions to
                        help you determine if refinancing your home makes good
                        financial sense.</p>

                        <p>The first question that everyone gets asked is,
                        'what is your <a href='../CreditScores.php'>credit score</a>?' Why is this number so
                        important to obtaining financing? For starters it tells
                        the banks and lenders how well you pay your bills. For
                        some that means great credit scores because they have
                        never had a late payment or may have only had a few
                        slight dings on their credit over time. Most banks and
                        lenders call these people with Good Credit the 'cream
                        of the crop.' Their credit scores are typically above
                        620. Those people with <a href='./BadCreditRefinancing.php'>Bad Credit</a> typically have scores
                        below 620 and are challenging, but not impossible to
                        refinance.</p>

                        <p>Once your credit score is determined you are
                        automatically placed, in the mind of the banker or
                        lender, into one of those two categories. Most of them
                        will say 'Yes' they can refinance you based only on
                        the credit score without looking at your financial
                        information. Be aware of the loan officers or mortgage
                        brokers that just jump at the chance to get a loan. In their way of doing business it
                        is all a numbers game. Some receive bonuses
                        based on the number of loans they close in a given
                        month, thus taking up your precious time only to tell
                        you three-quarters of the way through the process that
                        you don't qualify for that program any longer, or that
                        the interest rate has just gone up one percent, because
                        you no longer fit the 'cream of the crop' programs.</p>

                        <p>This big waste of time and effort happens because they didn't take the time at
                        the beginning of the process to get to know you and
                        your financial situation. If you are going to trust
                        someone to work in your best interest, wouldn't it be
                        great if they really knew and understood you, the
                        person, and not just you the numbers on a paper? You
                        are a human being after all, not just a number on a
                        page.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="RC" id="right">
                        <p>Once you have been placed in one of the two
                        categories, many things start to happen. If you have
                        Good Credit you will find that you can qualify for
                        more money when refinancing. Let's say, for the sake of
                        easy numbers, that your home is worth $100,000. You can
                        easily obtain a loan, without having to pay for <a href='../Answers/PMIAnswers.php'>private
                        mortgage insurance</a> (PMI), by obtaining a loan for 80%
                        or less of the Loan-to-Value (LTV) of your home. Thus,
                        in this scenario you would be able to obtain a loan for
                        $80,000. You may be able to qualify for up to 95%, or
                        $95,000, but we Lightning Mortgage consultants would
                        be better able to assist you in determining if that is
                        the right course of action for you because that high of a
                        LTV does require PMI.</p>

                        <p>If you fall into the Bad Credit category there are
                        two major changes to what you may or may not be able to
                        do. If your credit score is in the 580 - 619 range, you
                        may be able to qualify for <a href='../LoanTypes/FHA.php'>FHA or VA Loans</a>. Below 580
                        you will find that most banks and lenders will not even
                        talk to you or bother to give you advice on <a href='../CreditScores/CreditRepairAdvice.php'>credit
                        repair</a>. They only look at the here an now, not the
                        future. Our consultants remember you aren't just a
                        number on a piece of paper. You are a living breathing
                        person who deserves to be treated with respect. If you
                        own a home worth $100,000 and have bad credit then the value of
                        your property would only allow you to qualify for
                        at most 60%, or $60,000, of the value of your home.
                        The other down side of having bad credit is the interest rates offered by 
						lenders are typically much higher because you are considered a higher risk to the banks and
                        lending institutions.</p>
