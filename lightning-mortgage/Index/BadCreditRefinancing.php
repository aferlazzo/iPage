<p>A special note to those of you who have reached this web page because
you have bad credit want to refinance your mortgage or purchase a property. Perhaps you've been turned down
for refinancing at your local bank. The good news is that you can still refinance your mortgage even
if you have bad credit and potentially save money on your monthly payment. You can still buy the
home of your dreams, even if you've been labeled as someone with bad credit.</p>
<p><span class='Highlight'>Perhaps you don't have bad credit.</span> Perhaps your situation simply doesn't
fit into one of those nice neat loan programs offered by other lenders. Or perhaps you're fed up with
getting the run around or playing the games some lenders play.</p>
<blockquote class="PullQuote" style="width:175px">
Your search is over! Our pledge is to take care of your needs by finding the right financing for you.

<p>Please note that we have a strict policy against discrimination, including discrimination based on
<a href="../CreditScores/CreditScoreDefined.php">Credit Scores</a>. Call us a bad credit lender, a place
to come for a credit problem home loan. A place to obtain an investor mortgage. We'll do our best with
your financing request. Our pledge is to help you--whether you've got a few credit dings or need
drastic aid to stop foreclosure--improve your financial situation.</p></div><div class="RC" id="right">
<p>Are you tired of the empty promises you find on other web sites? Most ask you to fill out a loan
application without offering you any substance. Some sites promise to have lenders fighting over your
loan. Oh, believe me, you'll get a lot of calls. But getting calls and getting your problem solved are
two different things.</p>
<p>We provide information to you, allow you to make an informed decision, and assist you in making it a
reality. These web pages give you a taste of the methods we use to do this. Every step is explained in
straight-forward terms. Even so, there are probably going to be some terms that you don't understand.
If so, simply go to our handy <a href="../Answers/GlossaryAD.php">Glossary of Mortgage Terms</a>.</p>
<p>Once we learn about your situation we will advise you of your options. If you decide to move forward
we will take the necessary steps to make it happen. But we're not going to lie and promise you something
we can't deliver without having enough information. That's simply not our style and wastes everyone's
time.</p>
<p>You wouldn't want us to guess or approximate how we can help you. So we need facts. One of the critical
items that every loan is based on is your credit report and score. You might have an idea of your credit,
but we need to know your score and your credit history. We absolutely need to have our own copy, pulled
specifically for us, to make any recommendation on the best loan program for you.</p>
