	<p>&quot;What's your interest rate?&quot; That's the number one question
	prospective borrowers ask me. But I don't have a &quot;standard&quot; rate. The
	advertised rates are often &quot;teaser&quot;
	rates that only borrowers with the best credit scores can qualify. See <a
	href="./InterestRates/ShopTilTheyDrop.php">Shop 'Til They Drop</a>.</p>

	<p>Of course, we <span class="Highlight">can beat the interest rate of any other source </span>on the
	Internet. Sign up for our <a href="InterestRates/BelowMarketInterestRates.php">Home
	Loan Finder Service</a> to obtain the lowest interest rates.</p>

	<p>The interest rate can change with your loan-to-value ratio, your credit
	score, the type of property, your <a
	href="Answers/GlossaryAD.php#DebtToIncome">debt-to-income ratio</a>, income documentation, and a whole
	bunch of other factors.&nbsp; Offered rates can even change up to 3 times a day depending on
	market conditions!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="PullQuote" style="width:8em;">
Your rate = Your credit score + Your loan characteristics.
</blockquote>
	<p>Many people think that one size fits all when it comes to loan programs
	and rates.&nbsp; This just simply is not true.&nbsp; Remember, it's most important to <i>consider
	your interest rates on all of your debts</i>. Usually a slightly higher mortgage rate may be
	beneficial if you are able to combine other high interest debts and avoid paying mortgage
	insurance. Also, the interest may be tax deductible. See
	<a href="InterestRates/EducationTaxes.php">Common Homeowner Tax Deductions</a> to learn more.</p>

	<p>Is this home your principal residence? Your answer can greatly affect your interest rate. See Realty Times article, <a target="_blank" title="opens a new window"

	<p>are for non-traditional,
	non-conforming type loans. We have many loan programs with more liberal borrowing
	needs.&nbsp; These more lenient guidelines have interest rates which are somewhat higher.
	They're customized to fit your individual <a
	href="CreditScores.php">credit score</a> and your particular needs. In the area of <i>non-conforming</i>
	lending, we are able to help people of all credit grades. We have programs available for credit
	histories from A+ to D, programs for anyone who wants a more generous, or less common kind of
	residential real estate loan. If you're down,<span class="Highlight"> our goal is to help you get
	back on	your feet </span>and build a better credit profile. Rest assured that we will find you
	the best possible rate for the loan program that meets your needs.</p>
	<p>Did you know that the Federal Reserve's 'Fed Funds' rate is not closely
	tied to mortgage rates, as commonly thought? Rather, a mortgage rate is more closely linked
	with the expected rate of inflation! Click on <a

	<p>A smart shopper compares the prices and features of similar products
	before making a purchase decision. Be careful of <a

	closing cost fees</a>. Internet interest rate shoppers have good intentions, they just want to
	get the most value for their money. Yet<span class="Highlight"> the interest rate is not the only
	difference between any two lenders.</span> The differences are discussed as part of our <a

	explanation. Besides, the real interest rate can be different than the posted interest rate
	because of the following reasons:</p>

	<p>For any 'rate quote' to even be remotely close to a true number, you need

	<p> It's NOT a case of one-rate fits
	all in residential real estate mortgage lending. In other words, the rates published on other web
