<h1>Refinance Bankruptcy</h1>
<p>Believe it or not, sometimes refinancing is the best way to recover from a bankruptcy.
Refinancing to relieve pending foreclosures will help you save your house by borrowing from the built-up equity of your home.
Fear not that you are being threatened with foreclosure, have a bankruptcy or
delinquencies on your credit report. We have helped many people in similar situations qualify for a
loan refinance and save their home.</p>

<p>Before we get into that, a bit of advice for getting back on track: Call and talk to the Loss Mitigation Department of your
existing lender. They will tell you about some of your options but they will NOT necessarily tell you about ALL the possible options!</p>

<p>Normally, they will suggest a workout payment plan where you start making increased payments for some amount of time to
catch up with the amount you are behind. Foreclosure is stalled and as long as you follow the plan as agreed,
when you make the last repayment, the foreclosure is stopped completely.</p>

<p>But most people don't have enough money on a monthly basis to increase their payments. Another option that the
majority of people don't know about is asking for a Loan Modification. This is going to be more complicated and there
has to have been some mitigating circumstances in order for you to qualify. Basically, all past due payments are added to
the end of the loan or distributed across the <span class='Highlight'>life of the loan</span>.</p>
<p>You start making payments again a month or two after the agreement and you normally have to put
down the first month payment when this</p>
</div><div class="RC" id="right">
<span class="Frag">is approved. You can only do this
once in the life of the loan. Some Loan Modifications will allow you to skip up to six months of payments. You'll
have to negotiate with your lender. I hasten to add that <span class='Highlight'>we are not attorneys</span> and are
not offering legal advice.</span>
<h1>Foreclosure Help</h1>
<p>If you are one of those people whose foreclosure doesn't fall into those 'special cases' that would qualify for a
Loan Modification, then I might be able to help. We can discuss your foreclosure loan options and answer any questions you
may have about the foreclosure bail-out loan process.</p>

<p><span class='Highlight'>Be aware that in order to qualify for a foreclosure loan your <a href='..\Answers\GlossaryIL.php#Loan-To-Value'>loan-to-value (LTV)</a> must be 45% or lower.</span></p>

<p>Please email the following foreclosure property information to our office staff at
