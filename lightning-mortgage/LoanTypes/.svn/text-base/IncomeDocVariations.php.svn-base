	<p>Each and every borrower is unique. Many are paid by
	their employer on a regular basis and receive a W-2 at year end for tax
	reporting. For these borrowers a fully documented loan is customary.</p>
	<p>Others cannot document their income so easily. Some
	are paid cash, others are in business for themselves, still others have
	co-borrowers who do not receive a standard paycheck. In all of these
	cases some variation of limited documentation loan program is
	necessary. 
	<h3>Note: Presently Lenders are not offering these alternative, non-traditional, types of loans.</h3>
	<div style='background: red;border:3px solid black;padding:4px;'>
	<p>The 'flavors' of documentation include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Stated income/verified assets:
			Income is disclosed and the source of the income is
			verified, but the amount is not verified. Assets are
			verified, and must meet an adequacy standard such as,
			for example, 6 months of stated income and 2 months of
			expected monthly housing expense.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Stated income/stated assets: Both
			income and assets are disclosed but not verified.
			However, the source of the borrower's income is
			verified.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>No ratio: Income is disclosed
			and verified but not used in qualifying the borrower. The
			standard rule that the borrower's housing expense
			cannot exceed some specified percent of income, is
			ignored. Assets are disclosed and verified.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>No income: Income is not
			disclosed, but assets are disclosed and verified, and
			must meet an adequacy standard.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Stated assets or no asset
			verification: Assets are disclosed but not verified,
			income is disclosed, verified and used to qualify the
			applicant.</p>
		</li>
		<li> <p>No asset: Assets are not
			disclosed, but income is disclosed, verified and used
			to qualify the applicant.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>No income/no assets: Neither
			income nor assets are disclosed.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>Bear in mind that stated income type of loan doesn't mean you can borrow as much as you want,
regardless of whether it makes financial sense. A lender may ask you to sign an IRS 4506 form.
This form allows the lender to request a copy of your tax returns. Keep in mind that many lenders
will not use this form. They will simply hold on to it, using it as a scare tactic to make you tell the
truth about your income. If you default on the loan, they may use it as a tool to go after you for
fraud.</p>
