                    <p>Best of the Government Loans</p>
                </div>
                <div id="text" style='margin-bottom:20px;'>
                    <div class="LC" id="left" style=
                    "width:46%;padding:0 10px;">
                       <p>If you have come here it is because you feel you
                        either want an FHA (Federal Housing Authority) loan or
                        a VA (Veteran's Administration) loan. These two
                        government loans are very different from the mainstream
                        of mortgage loans in that they offer a higher sense of
                        security to the lender than most conventional mortgage
                        loans.</p>
 

                        <p>Let's start with an FHA loan and whether it is a
                        good fit for you.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Do you have a 620 or higher credit
                                score?</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Do you have less than 5% to pay toward a
                                down payment?</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Do you plan on staying in the home for a
                                long period of time, such as more than 5
                                years?</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Does your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceed
                                90%, thus making it hard for you to refinance
                                your existing mortgage?</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Is your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio 48% or
                                lower?</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you answered yes to any of these questions, an
                        FHA mortgage loan might be a good loan vehicle for your
