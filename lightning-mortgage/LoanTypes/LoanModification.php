	<p>Loan Modification has been used by lenders for years, however due to
market conditions and the subprime crunch, loan modification has
become the best solution for the problems facing the industry today. Homeowners
are finding their mortgages working against them, brokers are
unable to qualify the homeowner for a new loan, and bankers have no
option but to foreclose in record numbers. While some steps have been
taken by government agencies and the largest lenders/servicers to help
borrowers who are already delinquent, there is no national solution that
helps homeowners at risk of foreclosure before it’s too late.</p>
<p>In this environment, principal reductions that
restore some equity for the homeowner
may be a relatively more effective means
of avoiding delinquency and foreclosure.</p>
<p>When you are facing delinquency or foreclose you need to get help quickly. Once you provide us with a comprehensive 
list of your bills we can have an answer for you within 48 hours. If we think we can help you, we'll become your advocate 
and work with your lender to modify your mortgage to make it manageable.</p>
