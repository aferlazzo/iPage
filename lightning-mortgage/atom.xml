<a href="http://www.lightning-mortgage.com/Blog/">Confessions of a Mad Mortgage Consultant</a>
<br/>Yesterday, on January 1st, a new loan application came in. While I won't comment on every application, that it was the first to come in in 2005 makes it noteworthy. New purchase, although not much else has been filled out. I'll have to call and obtain some details. Still trying to get this blog working as I expect it to be, so this will be a good test.</div>

<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://lightning-mortgage.com/Blog" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<span style="font-family:verdana;">Hey maybe I should work for one of those big, boring, banal banks. Their motto, 'Wait in line, all the time.' Passbook savings, checking, safe-deposit boxes, IRAs, time deposit CDs, the works. After years of growing up in the corporate world, I know how to get around it. But I just find it so predictable, so limiting. You see, I like to help people and the corporate structure seems to be devised to do quite the opposite. Mad? Certainly in the eyes of those people still working at the bank.
<br/>
<br/>So I'm here as an independent. More interested in getting the job done than with climbing the corporate ladder. Don't want to do it all. Don't want to open up Christmas Club accounts, or credit cards. I'd rather do one thing, help people with mortgages. Who does that benefit? Why, you, the customer. Instead of pushing the latest loan of the week that my bank has decided is most profitable, I'm pushing the best loan for you, my client. Out of hundreds of lender products, I'm looking for the best fit for you.
<br/>
<br/>I'll chronicle highlights here in this blog. If I get too high and mighty, please tell me. After all, I'm doing this to obtain comments from you.</span>
