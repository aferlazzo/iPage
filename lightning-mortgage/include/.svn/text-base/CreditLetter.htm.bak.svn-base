<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Of course, you want to improve your credit score. It will enable you to qualify for lower 
interest loans. It will boost your borrowing power.</p>
<p>But you've got a less than stellar credit history. Money got tight and you made some
conflicting, confusing advice, and you made some repayment decisions that you now regret. Now
you want a low interest mortgage and pay the least amount for closing, and you should!</p>
<p>That's where I come in. I have helped my clients see their score jump 100 points after
following my advice. My lifelong goal has been to improve my clients financial standing.</p>

<p>In the past 20 years the way money is borrowed has changed dramatically as more and more
companies who extend credit to their customers have begun using standardized credit reports.
As the years have passed I've discovered exactly what works and what doesn't work when it
comes to raising credit scores the highest amount in the least amount of time.</p>

<p>Keep reading, and I'll show you exactly what works and what
does not work when it comes to improving your credit score.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is get you to understand what you're up against. Credit
scores will improve on their own over time as you establish good repayment history and resist
obtaining additional loans. But who has the time? We live in a society that requires using credit.
How many people can afford to buy a new car using cash? How many homes are bought in your
neighborhood for cash? Very few.</p>

<p>You depend on your credit score for many, many purchases. Like it or not, many people have
more plastic in their wallets than anything else.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is our own addiction to strategies that
never work...</p>

<h2 style='width:558px;'>Four strategies for saving money that never work<br /><br />...Yet people
always try</h2>
<b class="bottom"></b><b class="b4"></b><b class="b3"></b><b class="b2"></b><b class="b1"></b></div>
<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li><strong>The first strategy is to do nothing.</strong>Most people go into a state of denial,
 figuring things will be better next year. Deleting the voice messages from the mortgage and credit
 card companies, waiting, and hoping things will get better doesn't work. Then they get a notice
 posted on their door announcing the house is being auctioned. Or the car gets repossessed.</li>
 
<li><strong>The second is to open up one or more new credit card accounts to pay off the old one.</strong>
Shuffling debt from one creditor to another is a shell game that you can never win. Your score will
never go up using this method. It just keeps the wolf from your door a little longer, perhaps, by
lowering, or eliminating interest payments for some time period.</li>
<li><strong>The third strategy is to declare bankruptcy.</strong> Some people think that debt is
eliminated. Oh what a relief it is! Or was. Bad news. The debt isn't automatically eliminated. Today's
bankruptcy laws are much more restrictive, and expensive, to file. It may have gotten angry phone calls
from creditors to stop, but it doesn't improve your credit score.</li>
<li><strong>The fourth strategy is to ask friends and family for help.</strong> Using others good credit
to make purchases by co-signing on loans may get you a new car, or a house, but it will do nothing to
improve your scores.</li>
</ol>

<p>My strategy is to examine your credit report and tell you what to do that will have the greatest
impact on improving the scores. I do not run a consumer credit counseling or repair service, even
though the information packed reports I'll send you will achieve the same result.</p>

<p>Many people take a pessimistic view. They figure they have too much to learn. They just want to
move into a home of their dreams, and be done with it. Spending a few dollars more each month is no
big deal. Well, they are wrong.</p>

<p>Would you needlessly spend $50,000 to $200,000 more for a home than you need to pay? Probably
not. But if you have a mortgage that is a point or two higher than it would to if you had great
credit then you could wind up over-paying even more for the same house.</p>

<p>For most people like you, improving your credit score is about as interesting as doing your
income taxes. But if you spend some time on it, you will be able to qualify for a better home
mortgage. Here's three things that can make a difference:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Arming yourself with knowledge about how credit scores work is the best defense against
 paying more than you need to pay when buying and owning a home.</li>
 <li>Having a clear overall financial picture, and how your mortgage fits into that picture.</li>
 <li>Working with and obtaining advice from a trusted source, a down-to-earth, level headed expert.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am available to help you lower your credit scores so you can obtain the lowest interest rate
mortgage. One that will meet your needs. Sign-up to receive strategies that will save you money,
big money. I discuss many of them in my free Credit Score Secrets series of messages. This 
information will be emailed to you over at regular intervals.</p>
