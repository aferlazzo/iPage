<h1>Acquire Commercial Property with No Money Down</h1>
<h3>Build Wealth</h3>
<p>Here's a great way to acquire commercial property without sinking a lot of working capital into it. This financial product will <span class='Highlight'>enable you to acquire more commercial property and build wealth quicker</span>. You deserve to know about this little known financing secret that your banker doesn't even know about!</p>
<h3>Just Imagine The Implications</h3>
<p>Now you can purchase income-producing property without locking up your equity. Incredible as it sounds, real estate investors can now acquire and obtain financing for 100% of the costs of construction or renovation.</p> 
<p>That's right: <span class='Highlight'>100% LTV on commercial property</span>. If that isn't unheard of, hang on to your hat because not only can you purchase commercial property without being forced into having an equity stake in it, you can also finance the furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E)! Up to 30% of the amount financed can be applied toward fees, equipment, even marketing costs.</p> 
<p>What about buying franchises? Yes, they can be financed in this manner, too!</p>
<h3>Exceptional Flexibility</h3>
<p><span class='Highlight'>Purchasing</span> properties becomes easier using this financing strategy. With the "Plus" component of this product, your clients won't have to come up with the cash for the extra start-up costs typically needed for FF&E (or other uses). Imagine this: no upfront costs for startups. That's a great way to make their balance sheet look healthy.</p> 
<p>Another wonderful use of this financing product is for <span class='Highlight'>refinancing</span> existing property. What equity that was previously locked up can now be better leveraged and converted into cash.</p> 
<p>Good news for servicing the debt: Payments are more attractive than you would guess. Payments will remain fixed for 20 years. No balloons. No rate reviews. </p>
<p>Let me tell you more. This financing can also be used for from-the-ground-up construction. Best of all, you don't start paying until the building is occupied.  What other financing option will take that kind risk off the shoulders of purchasers?</p>
<p>If you would like a method of purchasing commercial property that fulfills the promise of multiplying their net worth, stop watching those get-rich-quick late-night infomercials. At last, you have <span class='Highlight'>a <i>real</i> solution</span>.</p> 
<p>There is just too much important information about this product for a brief letter. Act now to find out more about this product. Contact us today for more information on how this loan product will help your clients.</p>
