		<h3>About Pronto Commercial Funding</h3>

		<div id='me'></div>
		<p>I'm Anthony Ferlazzo and I've been helping
		people find out-of-the-box solutions solutions to their commercial financing needs for 5 years. I'm
		based in Pleasanton, California.</p>
		<span class='mediumGreen'>How I work</span>
		<p>With new clients I try and ask a lot of questions to uncover exactly
		what the client wants (why they contact me in the first place) and then try to determine
		what the client needs. What is so curious is that often
		it is not the solution they have arrived at prior to contacting me.</p>

		their money. We offer high yield programs and strategies for multiplying your
		wealth.</p>

		commercial lending community. We arrange conventional financing through
		institutions and use private money sources for non-traditional or unique
		financing requests.</p>

		<h3>Solutions For Today</h3>
		<p>Commercial financing solutions tool-set has changed, and we've changed with
		it. Pronto Commercial Funding provides Proof of Funds service, access to Private
		Placement Programs, and funds for bank instruments such as SBLCs and other Letters
		of Credit, MTNs, BGs. </p>

		<p>We work with private and institutional lenders, traders, investors. Being very
		experienced with investing and trading is paramount to getting the job done, but
		we also maintain that wise investing is only possible if we make certain you feel
		that (for lending) your investment is very safe and secure, and (for trading) your
		money will grow at a rapid pace.</p>

		<h3>For the Open-Minded Few</h3>
		<p>The new and unfamiliar is not always easy, fun, and without problems. We work
		hard to overcome your initial distrust, if it is present, but also understand that
		until the transaction is complete and you see results, you may still remain skeptical.</p>

		<p><span class='mediumGreen'>One bad apple doesn't mean new financing won't work</span></p>
		<p>Skepticism is natural once you've had a bad experience. We recognize we have to prove
		ourselves again and again through our actions and making good on our promises.</p>

		<p>There are limits. We can not foretell the future. We act on good faith and occasionally
		will give you inaccurate or misleading statements made by others, but only because we
		believe they are true when we present them to you. When we tell you to expect one course
		of action and have another one actually occur brings on feelings of distrust, so we work
		hard to filter out inaccurate information before forwarding it to you.</p>

		<h3>First Steps Are Challenging</h3>

		<p>We understand that the journey to your goal is often complex. So the two-way street of
		frequent communication during this stage is another very important component of what we do.
		Being able to describe the process with enough detail to make you confident and safe during
		the process is the first step. Carrying out the agreed upon plan is the second step.</p>

		<p>Quite often people come to us after having had very bad experiences with other traders
		or lenders. Programs that don't pay, loans that never close, and dealing with people that
		don't tell the truth. While we can't erase what is in the  past, we make certain not to
		repeat the mistakes of others.</p>
