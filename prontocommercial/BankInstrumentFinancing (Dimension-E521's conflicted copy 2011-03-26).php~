		<h3 title='Monetize Your Instrument'><a href='#'></a></h3>
		<div class='panelContent nonFeedback'>
			<p>
				An Instrument purchased directly from a bank at a percentage near the Face Value
				is an Owned Instrument. Very expensive. Leased instruments are actually leased from an investor
				who owns a very large instrument for a much lower amount.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most common financing strategy typically used with both leased or
				owned bank instrument is resell them to an Exit Buyer who is willing
				to pay above the purchased price. Another common practice is to
				hold the bank instrument to be placed in a Private Placement Program trade. A third practice
				is to have the instrument monetized or get a loan against the instrument.
