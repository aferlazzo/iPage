				the contract. After you have agreed, signed and returned the
				contract to the lender, the first tranche will be sent.</li>

			<h3>Monetize Your Instrument</h3>
			<p>
				An Instrument purchased directly from a bank at a percentage near the face value
				is an Owned Instrument. Very expensive. Leased instruments are actually leased from an investor
				who owns a very large instrument for a much lower amount.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class='mediumGreen'>The most common financing strategy</span> used with both leased or
				owned bank instruments is to resell them to an Exit Buyer who is willing
				to pay above the purchased price. Another common practice is to
				hold the bank instrument to be placed in a Private Placement Program trade. A third practice
				is to have the instrument monetized or get a loan against the instrument.

			<h3>Monetization Process in a Nutshell</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Client completes attached application.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Client completes the <a href='./CISform.php'>Client Information Sheet</a> and submit it.
				Then upload the listed documents.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Minimum amount is $10 Million. Client must be able to have a MT-760 message for the cash-backed
				instrument sent from their bank to the lender's bank.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Lender issues a contact for a non-recourse loan to client.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Client nets 65% of the face value of instrument with no need to repay loan.</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p>There are many, many fraudulent bank instruments floating around. Many people try to pass these off as being real.
			If the instrument is real then it will be funded, but if it is not then clients are unlikely to pay $35,000 to have
			it authenticated. Process takes 2-4 weeks.</p>
