			<h3>Your Changing Needs</h3>
			<p>
				In today's financial environment it is difficult to obtain financing no matter what your credit history.
				The <span class='Highlight'>ONLY</span> way that makes sense during these tough financial times is to
				use cash-backed bank instruments like a Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC), Bank Guarantee (BG), or
				Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as collateral.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also can <span class='Highlight'>optionally</span> monetize or provide <a href='./BankInstrumentFinancing.php'>loans</a> against
				these type of instruments. Some of these loans are non-recourse, and require no collateral other than the
				instrument itself. For those who want to own them, we also offer SBLCs, BGs, and fresh-cut MTNs for
				purchase. Contact us for further information.

			<h3>Why Lease Instruments?</h3>
			<p>
				When you obtain a bank instrument at a discounted percentage, below the actual face value, it is called a
				Leased Instrument. Rather than reselling the Leased Instrument for a yield-spread profit, the instrument is
				leased by the investor, at a rate of well below the face value. This is repeated continuously and within a
				short period, the original cost is recovered and profits are realized from the Leased Instrument.
			</p>
			<p>
				Leased Instruments are utilized for various reasons like Credit Enhancement, Trade Programs, and
				Collateralization for a Loan or to have the Leased Instrument Monetized to Cash for a myriad of projects. It is
				good that you found us because we lease instruments at a competitive price and can provide, deliver and
				offer programs that are of value for your projects.

			<h3>Leasing Procedures</h3>
			<p>Our standard, and <em>preferred</em> method of transacting business is to use a third-party
			escrow escrow using a licensed attorney's <a href='Glossary.php#IOLTA'>IOLTA</a> for both yours and our protection.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>
					Complete a <a href='./CISform.php'>Client Information Sheet</a>
					and submit it along with the listed documents.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>A service agreement outlining the contractual term is issued.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Sign and return the service and escrow agreement.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>Wire escrow lease fees to the third-party escrow company.</span></li>
				<li><span class='normalSized'>The instrument is sent by SWIFT to your nominated bank.</span></li>
