		<h3>Commercial Loans</h3>
		<h2><span class='mediumGreen'>Limited Time Special Offer</span></h2>
		<p>
			While we offer the most competitive financing products from institutional lenders for
			commercial properties, we also have access to private investors who provide funding and hard money lenders.
		</p>
		<h4 class='caption'>
			90% Funding Offering @ 3% Interest
		</h4>
		<p>
			This is a funding system setup by a Private Investor. The 10% must be placed into an escrow
			account mutually agreed upon. Minimum funding amount is $1 Million USD, NO MAX LIMIT.

		<h3>Engagement of Investor</h3>
		<p>
			Once our private investor has an interest in the project a conference call will be
			setup with you and the investor to discuss the loan terms. After both parties agree
			on the terms a term sheet will be submitted to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			An underwriter will also review the project and determine whether it is ready to be underwritten.
			At that point a conditional commitment to fund will be issued.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next,  a draw-down schedule that will be agreed on by both parties. Typical draw-downs are
			12 - 16 or 24 months. Following the commitment a closing date will be set. This whole process
			will take 60 to 90 days.
		</p>
		<p>
			There will be a table top closing in New York or Las Vegas.
		</p>

		<h3>Timing of Costs</h3>
		<p>
			There will be an underwriting, application and legal fee of $15,000 with the return of the signed
			term sheet. If for any reason the client project is rejected $13,000 will be return to the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the project is accepted you will need to wire the 10% of the funded amount to the agreed
			upon escrow when you receive the conditional commitment to fund letter. At that point the
			investor's insurance company will send the you an insurance guarantee for the money in
			escrow. The escrow company will send you the loan / funding agreement and release the funds to
			the investor after receiving a copy of the insurance guarantee.

		<h3>Other Lending</h3>
		<p>
			We offer access to both traditional (institutional) and private (hard money) investor
			loans typically peak at 65% loan-to-value.
		</p>
		<p>
			Need to borrow more than any other commercial lender will allow? We have a
			<a href='./BankInstrumentFinancing.php'>Bank Instrument Financing</a> product than
			enables us to offer loans with LTVs or loan amounts that most Hard Money loans can't compare.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your loan note has been called, or the rate review has increased your payments to an
			intolerable level, we can consult with you on possible courses of action.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every commercial financing situation is unique. And complex. That's the nature of the beast.
			We'll review your project, discuss your specific needs with you, and create a custom program
			to suit your needs.
