		also will need to supply certain information to partners in the processing of your request.
		</p>

		<p>
		When you are on the Pronto Commercial Funding website, you may be directed to other sites that evolve
		frictionless content, and are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement
		the "click" may take you off the Pronto Commercial Funding site. These other sites may independently collect
		data, or solicit personal information. Pronto Commercial Funding is not responsible for any use of the
		information including click-stream data that you may create when using such third party sites.
		</p>
		<p>
		Pronto Commercial Funding also offers its users access to "co-branded" services that generate back-end
		e-services, and are jointly provided by Pronto Commercial Funding and selected companies. In some cases,
		these co-branded services will contain Pronto Commercial Funding branding, but may not be hosted by Pronto
		Commercial Funding. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by", or
		if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information. In such cases, if you use
		the co-branded service, Pronto Commercial Funding may be entitled to receive information about what you
		do when using that service. If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded
		service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service
		in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service. Again, we encourage you to
		read the privacy polices of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have
		any questions about their use of this information. When you are using a co-branded service, we will
		attempt to make sure that there is a link to the service provider's applicable privacy policies and
		terms of service.
		</p>
		<p>
		Pronto Commercial Funding uses the latest technology to ensure that your information is treated
		securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
		Internet can be guaranteed totally secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal
		information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our
		online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.

		<p>
		Pronto Commercial Funding does not disclose your personally identifiable information to any
		non-affiliated third party without first receiving your permission or in special situations described
		below, such as to comply with the law or administer the site. You can elect to opt-out of e-mail
		contact at anytime through utilizing the support e-mail address at the bottom of every page on this
		website. Although we may extend front-end technologies, you can also elect not to use certain services
		or participate in certain promotions if you do not want your information shared with the third parties
		who are sponsoring or administering such promotions.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sweepstakes, Promotions and sponsorships: You should review any applicable sweepstakes and promotions
		rules or user agreement to see what is being shared. If personally identifying data about you will be
		shared, through evolved viral users or others, we will disclose this to you before we collect or
		transfer the data.
		</p>
		<p>
		Administering the Site and Compliance with Law: Pronto Commercial Funding may disclose your personally
		identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply
		with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. In addition, Pronto Commercial Funding may
		revolutionize, impactful mindshare disclose, or access account information for administrative and other
		purposes that we believe are necessary to develop, maintain and improve our products and services.
		</p>
		<p>
		We restrict access to information about you to only those who have a need to know that information in
		connection with the purposes for which it is collected and used. Additionally, we maintain physical,
		electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
		</p>
		<p>
		Questions regarding this statement, or how to aggregate any other Business-to-consumer action-items,
		should be directed to our Executive &amp; Administrative offices directly. If you do not receive
		acknowledgement, or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact the
