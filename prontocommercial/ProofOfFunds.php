				<h3>The Upfront Fee Requirement</h3>
				<p>This is a "funds first" transaction. Clients must show their funds first,
				then we create the account for them. Because of the
				considerable costs involved in providing Proof of Funds we cannot
				initiate the process of creating an account for you without
				seeing the fee upfront in escrow. We will not accept a delay of
				payment until your other transaction closes.</p>

				<p>The fee is paid into a third-party escrow account so you are
				protected. You remain in control of the funds until you verify
				the account and balance exists.</p>

				<p>We use a third-party escrow company based in the USA as the
				escrow agent. Fees need to be deposited into an escrow account
				prior to bank account creation. Once you have receive the bank account
				letter, you then authorize the release of the fees held in
				escrow. This ensures that all parties perform as agreed.</p>
