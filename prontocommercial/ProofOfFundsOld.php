				<h3 title='The Upfront Fee Requirement'><a href='#'></a></h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class='panelContent '>
			<p>
				This is a "funds first" transaction. Because of the considerable costs involved in providing Proof of Funds we cannot initiate the process of creating an account for you without seeing the fee upfront in escrow. We will not accept a delay of payment until your other transaction closes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fee is paid into a third-party escrow account so you are protected. You remain in control of the funds until you verify the account and balance exists.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use a third-party escrow company based in the USA as the escrow agent. Fees need to be deposited into an escrow account prior to bank account creation. Once you receive the bank account letter, you then authorize the release of the fees held in escrow. This ensures that all parties perform as agreed.
