        Commercial Hard Money loans have a much lower closing rate than other commercial loans, but they should not be ignored when they come your way. The pay off for submitting a loan that closes is worth weeding out the junk that won't. For example, last week, we closed an $18 Million dollar hard money loan for a developer that we received as a referral. There was a half point on the loan to the referrer, a check for around $90,000 from just ONE loan is incredible. It would have taken around 30 residential loans to equal the same gross as that one closing. A word of caution. Don't be greedy. The deal just won't fly if you expect to make more than a half point for just referring.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to these big deals is knowing what makes a deal viable and knowing who to trust that can really fund and close on these loans. There are companies out there that take large up front fees and just never fund the loans. Besides having a realistic present and future value, borrower investment in the deal, what makes a hard money deal viable is the exit strategy. In other words, how borrowers are going to repay the loan.

        Commercial hard money is NOT like residential hard money. With residential hard money the key is that no hard questions are asked of the borrower (like how they plan to repay the loan). The key is having a low LTV. Investors don't care if they have to foreclose on a property. These investors really are lending with the expectation, the intention of acquiring the property. They figure they'll be able to quickly sell the property and make a quick buck.
      </p>
      <p>
        In commercial hard money, we do NOT want to foreclose because foreclosed commercial buildings (or land) can sit on the market for years. I'm sure you have seen some abandoned buildings sitting around for years where you live. Commercial hard money investors want to see a low LTV, but they want to know the exit strategy. They are not lending with the intention of acquiring the property.
      </p>
      <p>
        We won't do a full underwrite; sometimes we may not order an appraisal, instead relying on local Realtors and getting a feel for the market. I hasten to add that this can happen ONLY in cases where we can get a good feel for the value. Otherwise we will order the appraisal. If you have one, we'll look at it, but we still may require a new one. We will fly into town and see the market; meeting with the clients if we can. We look for assurances that this loan will be repaid within a year. We can close quickly - most in just a few weeks but we won't close without feeling comfortable that we will be repaid in short order - typically under 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides knowing the deal, knowing who really funds this stuff is critical. That is where teaming with a commercial financing expert like me can really come in handy. It doesn't matter how many deals pass through your office. The most important thing is that the deal ACTUALLY CLOSES! In the scenario above, the $18 Million one, the loan was brought to us by a broker who made a half point. That means some broker, who probably does not know what he is doing, but had a deal come his way, is making $90,000 on this one closing. That could just as well be you. Don't let these big deals go just because they have not worked out for you in the past. I am very experienced and CAN close tough commercial projects.
