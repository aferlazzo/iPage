Can I lease a SBLC or BG for 1 month?
Our instrument leasing term is typically 1 year. Perhaps a Proof Of Funds account would suit your needs better if the term is shorter than a year.

Why do I have to put the fee into escrow? I want to pay the lease fee at closing.
Most people do not realize that there are costs incurred when we lease instruments. Just sending a MT-799 or MT-760 message is not possible 
without first creating the instrument or account for you. Any other way would be commiting fraud, which we refuse to do.

All I'm asking for is a letter on bank letterhead saying that I have money in it. How can it cost so much?
You may just be asking for a letter but we have to still go through the motions of creating and account and depositing the necessary
funds in it. To create a letter without having the actual account fully funded to back it up is a way for us to quickly go out of
business and get throuwn into jail. Sorry, but we don't want to have that happen.

Can you finance a BG that I am planning to have issued to me?
It depends on the BG, and until you have it issued so that we can examine and authenticate it we simply don't know.
