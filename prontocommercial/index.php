				<h3>Welcome To A New Financial World</h3>
				<p>
					<span class='mediumGreen'>Ten years ago</span> obtaining a creative commercial financing was almost
					as easy as obtaining a no-money-down home mortgage. Everyone
					was offering easy-to-qualify-for loans.
				</p>
				<p>
					The financial landscape has certainly changed. <span class='mediumGreen'>These days</span>
					obtaining any kind of financing is difficult. Banks are no longer client-friendly. Our groups are.
					We offer solutions that are unavailable through traditional commercial financing channels.
				</p>
				<p>
					The project is now the most important issue.
				</p>

				<h3>Proof of Funds</h3>
				<p>
					Our <a href='./ProofOfFunds.php'>Proof Of Funds</a> service enables	clients who	need to
					complete their business acquisition or other transactions and would
					like to <span class='firstTestGreen'>indicate greater financial strength.</span> We offer the strongest,
					most flexible, most comprehensive and complete Proof of Funds products available.

				<h3>Private Placement Programs</h3>
				<p>
					Our <a href='./PrivatePlacementProgram.php'>Private Placement Programs</a> enable high net worth
					clients along with others to have their money grow at a tremendous
					rate. Other programs will enable you to increase your net worth quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Applicants are expected to be experienced investors who are familiar
					with these types of investments.</p><p>We <span class='scratchy'>DO NOT</span> educate or provide any
					advice as to how one can incorporate this PPP strategy into your financial plan.

				<h3>Bank Instrument Financing</h3>
				<p>
					<span class='mediumGreen'>This is your lucky day.</span> You have also located a great site to <a href="./BankInstrumentFinancing.php">finance</a> your existing Stand-by
					Letter of Credit or other bank instrument.
				</p>
				<p>
					We finance Stand-by Letters of Credit (SBLCs), Bank Guarantees
					(BGs), Certificates of Deposit (CDs), Treasuries, MTNs, Bonds and
					other bank instruments that are unconditional, irrevocable,
					assignable, and without liens against them.</p>

				<h3>Bank Instrument Leasing</h3>
				<p>
					In today's financial environment it is difficult to obtain financing
					no matter what your credit history. Yet we provide commercial
					financing when traditional lenders fail.
				</p>
				<p>
					The way that makes sense during these tough financial times is
					to use ONLY cash-backed bank instruments like a Stand-by
					Letter of Credit (SBLC), Bank Guarantee (BG), or Certificates of
					Deposit (CDs) as collateral. We offer exceptional <a href="./BankInstrumentLeasing.php">Bank Instrument
					Leasing</a> solutions.

				<h3>Commercial Lending</h3>
				<p>
					We excel at offering  premium loan products that banks and
					traditional financing options just can't offer. <span class='mediumGreen'>This is arguably the best part of our business, by the way.</span>
					Financing solutions for all property types (except raw land) and business financing.
