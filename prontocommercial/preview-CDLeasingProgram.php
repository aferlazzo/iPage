      Certificate of Deposit Leasing
    </h1>
    <p>
		This is probably the best program to come across my desk this year.</p>

	<p>My provider's primary business is to loan bank instruments to clients to be used as collateral, credit enhancement, or a balance sheet enhancement for qualified transactions around the world.
		They have the ability to issue and deliver cash backed bank instruments in the form of Standby Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, and Certificates of Deposit.</p>
	<ul>Issuing banks include
			<li>HSBC London</li>
			<li>Barclays London</li>
			<li>ABN Amro Amsterdam</li>
			<li>UBS Zurich or Geneva</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We issue bank instruments for a minimum amount of $/�10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars/Euros) and above.
		Bank Instruments can be leased for terms of one (1), three (3), and five (5) years, with the option to renew prior to maturity.
	</p>

	<h2>Advantages of Bank Instruments</h2>

	<p>What makes our collateral such a powerful funding tool?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The bank instruments we provide are one hundred percent (100%) cash backed collateral.</li>
		<li>Under certain circumstances, we can cause the issuance and delivery of a bank instrument in the name of our client as beneficiary, or assign a bank instrument to their favor.</li>
		<li>We only require a corporate undertaking to return the bank instrument at maturity.</li>
		<li>The beneficiary has the option to</li>
			<ol><li>Return the bank instrument fifteen (15) days prior to maturity</li>
			<li>Pay the face value of the bank instrument at maturity</li>
			<li>Renew the bank instrument for an additional term.</li></ol>
		The option to purchase the borrowed asset is unique in the marketplace.
		<li>We issue our bank instruments at top European banks to assure worldwide acceptance of the instruments.</li>
		<li>Collateral based project funding has less strenuous requirements for the borrower�s financial strength than traditional project funding.</li>
	</ul>

In addition, provide the beneficiary's address, the name of the representative and/or officer responsible for executing all agreements, his/her title, and contact information.  Provide a copy of the corporate documents for the company, including the by-laws, corporate resolution, and a color copy of the passport for the legal representative of the company responsible for executing all agreements.

3.	Confirm if the bank instrument will be used as collateral to guarantee repayment of a loan (whereby our bank instrument will be at risk), or if the bank instrument will be used for balance sheet enhancement (whereby our bank instrument will not be at risk/encumbered).

4.	Provide a copy of your business plan, feasibility study, executive summary, and/or an explanation for the use of funds.

5.	Provide full and complete banking coordinates for where the bank instrument will be delivered.

6.	Confirm the receiving bank's preferred method of delivery, either DTC/Euroclear screen system or SWIFT.

VI.  PROJECT REVIEW AND CONTRACT

�	Upon our receipt of the Letter of Request and the supplemental transaction details, we will begin our due diligence process.
�	Once we have discussed the delivery specifications with our potential client, and are satisfied with the candidates ability to pay the issuance and delivery cost, we will provide a draft agreement that will define all terms, conditions, procedures, and costs for the transaction.
�	The contract will have a direct reference to a project, a line of credit, credit enhancement, and/or balance sheet enhancement that is in place, or that can be put in place.
�	After executing the contract, plan for approximately thirty (30) to forty five (45) days to conclude the transaction from start to finish.

VII.  PRICING

�	There are many factors that determine the cost for the use of the bank instrument, including the bank instrument amount, method of delivery, and the settlement procedures.  All costs for the use of the bank instrument will be identified after our evaluation of the transaction details.  The net price for the use of the bank instrument ranges from seventeen percent (17%) for the use of a bank instrument for a one (1) year term, twenty seven percent ( 27% ) for a three (3) year term, forty percent (40%) for a five (5) year term.  This is a net cost which does not include compensation for intermediaries.  We can add up to two percent (2%) per transaction to the net cost for the use of a bank instrument to protect compensation for all intermediaries involved in a transaction.
